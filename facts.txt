The Moon is the Earth's only natural satellite. A natural satellite is a space body that orbits a planet, and includes asteroids.
Earth's Moon is the fifth largest moon in our solar system. 
The average distance between Earth and the Moon is 384,403 km.
The Moon orbits the earth every 27.3 days. 
The tallest mountain on the Moon is Mons Huygens, at 4700 meters tall. This is half the height of Mt. Everest. 
Because the moon rotates on its axis in roughly the same amount of time it takes to orbit Earth, we only ever see 60% of the moon's surface (50% at any given time). The other side of the moon is often called the "dark side." 
Gravity on the moon is 17% of what we experience on Earth. 
The first unmanned spacecraft reached the Moon in 1966, and was part of the Soviet Union's Luna program.
The USA's NASA Apollo 11 mission was the first human moon landing, in 1969.
The surface of the moon has a huge number of impact craters from asteroid and comet collisions earlier in its life. Because the moon has no atmosphere, these craters are well-preserved.
The Moon is very hot during the day (average: 107 degrees Celsius) but very cold at night (-153 degrees Celsius).
The Earth's tides are caused largely by the gravitational pull of the Moon on Earth. 
A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth is between the Sun and the Moon. 
The NASA Apollo missions brought back over 2,000 moon rock samples. 
The volume of the Moon is roughly the same as the volume of the Pacific Ocean. 
The gravitational force of the moon in relation to Earth slows Earth's rotation by about 1.5 milliseconds per century and raises the moon into higher orbit by about 3.8 centimeters or 1.5 inches per year.
In approximately 15 billion years, the moon and Earth's gravitational pulls on each other would stabilize. But in approximately 7 billion years, the sun will have become a red giant star, completely engulfing and incinerating the moon and Earth.
Strange colored lights have sometimes been seen briefly on the moon's surface. Scientists believe these lights are made by gases that leak from deep inside the moon.
Although a full moon seems bright, it is actually reflecting just 7% of the sun's rays.
There are three kinds of moon rocks: basalt (dark), anorthosite (light), and breccia (a mixture of several rocks). These types of rocks are also found on Earth.
Cell phones today are 400 times more powerful than the computer that helped guide humans to the moon.
Apollo 11 had only 20 seconds of fuel left when they landed on the moon.
Apollo 15 was the first mission to use a lunar rover. The top speed that was ever recorded in this 4-wheeled land vehicle was 10.56 miles per hour.
When Alan Sheppard was on the moon, he hit a golf ball and drove it 2,400 feet, nearly one half a mile.
The moon has no global magnetic field.
Scientists aren't entirely sure how the Moon formed. A popular theory is that a Mars-sized rock, named Theia, crashed into Earth around 4.5 billion years ago. The debris from the collision clumped together to make what is now our Moon!
Moonquakes, which originate several miles below the moon's surface, may be a result of Earth's gravitational pull. Engineers say these quakes could become a factor if lunar bases are ever built on the moon.
Approximately 49 moons could fit into Earth.
The entire surface of the moon is covered in a layer of crushed and powdered rocks called regolith (from the Greek rhegos = blanket + lithos = rock). The dust is a result of millions of years of bombardment from space by tiny micrometeorites.
A lunar eclipse, when Earth passes between the sun and the moon, lasts longer than a solar eclipse because Earth's shadow is so much larger.
Because the surface of the moon has no wind or water, an astronaut's footprint could last for millions of years.
The oldest known map of the moon, about 5,000 years old, was found carved into a rock in a prehistoric tomb at Knowth, County Meath, in Ireland. Before this was discovered, the oldest known lunar map was by Leonardo da Vinci, which was created around 1505.
